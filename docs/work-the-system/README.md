# Work the system methodology

This document describe the document set used to work the primary **ESTEEM8 system**.

## Introduction

```
A system is what make it does what it perform.
```

#### Vocabulary
* **A system** is a composition of nested systems composed of _functions_.
* **A function** is a composition of _process_ grouped by a type.
* **A process** is a series of _mechanical and chemical operations_.

Basicaly these components above are working similary as a program. Comparing to web component framework, a system is a component, a function is a function and a process is a native language function.

## Document set
### The what

* [/definiton](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/definition)
 * [System composition](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-composition.md) is the detailed current whole system state.
 * [System objectives](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-objectives.md) is the detailed current system objectives, goal or destination.

### The how

 * [/strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies)
   * [/optimization strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/optimization-strategies) is the way to optimize the current system.
   * [/development strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/development-strategies) is the way to develop the current system.
   * [/projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/projects) are projects made from strategies.

### The how of "what + how"
 
 * [/tools](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/tools)
   * [Organization principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/make-strategy-principles.md) is a tool to plan the way to optimize and develop the current system.
   * [Process principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/process-strategy-principles.md) is a tool to work the way planned.
  
## Explanations
### Organization level

* [Objectives](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-objectives.md) are made for a very long term planning.
* [Strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies) are made for a long term planning and translated from composition & objectives [grouped by output].
* [Projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/projects) are made for a middle term planning from mixed strategy parts [grouped by work type and strategies].
* [Tasks](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/issues) are made for a short term planning from mixed projects parts [grouped by work type].

All organization level or layer [Objectives, strategies, projects and tasks] can be [Linked, Nested, Have [dependency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_(project_management)), Have [relationships](https://www.google.com/search?q=entity+relationship+diagram)] with all organization level or layer.

These 4 point above are organizational (process description) and sorted from a high level to a low level.
 * High level -> lowly precise process description, morely grouped by objective and plan type.
 * Low level -> highly precise process description, morely grouped by skills and process type.
* Organization principles are tools to write and precise these process descriptions also called objectives, strategies, projects and tasks.
* Process principles are tools to translate process descriptions into mechanical and biological process.

#### Using "Organization principles" doc [Describe]

* [layer 1] [**What**](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/definition): [composition & objectives] ->

* [layer 2] [**How**](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies): [composition optimization & objectives development] ->

* [layer 3] **Projects:** [[/projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/projects), [GitHub projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/projects), [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/milestones) (with the same name)] ->

* [layer 4] **Tasks:** [[GitHub issues](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/issues) filtered by skills(label) & projects(milestone)].

#### Using "Process principles" doc [Process]

* **Tasks:** -> Mechanical and biological process [Your process]
